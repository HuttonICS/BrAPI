|additionalInfo|object|Additional arbitrary info|
|callSetDbId|string|The ID of the call set this variant call belongs to.  If this field is not present, the ordering of the call sets from a `SearchCallSetsRequest` over this `VariantSet` is guaranteed to match the ordering of the calls on this `Variant`.

|values|array|Repeated field of dynamically typed values.|
|genotype_likelihood|array[number]|The genotype likelihood for this variant call. Each array entry represents how likely a specific genotype is for this call as log10(P(data  genotype)), analogous to the GL tag in the VCF spec. The value ordering is defined by the GL tag in the VCF spec.|
|phaseSet|string|If this field is populated, this variant call's genotype ordering implies the phase of the bases and is consistent with any other variant calls on the same contig which have the same phase set string.|

### Post - /search/callsets [POST /brapi/v2/search/callsets]

Submit a search request for `CallSets`<br/>
Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
Use the corresponding `GET /search/callsets/{searchResultsDbId}` to retrieve the results of the search. <br/> 
Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.
