What Is BrAPI?
==============

The Breeding API specifies a standard interface for plant
phenotype/genotype databases to serve their data to crop breeding
applications. It is a shared, open API, to be used by all data providers
and data consumers who wish to participate. Initiated in May 2014, it is
currently in an actively developing state, so now is the time for
potential participants to help shape the specifications to ensure their
needs are addressed. The listserve for discussions and announcements is
here. Additional documentation is in the Github wiki. For demos and
implementations examples checkout apiary documentation.

| The Breeding API (BrAPI) is a **Standardized RESTful Web Service API
  Specification** for communicating Plant Breeding Data. BrAPI allows
  for easy data sharing between databases and tools involved in plant
  breeding.

API
   An Application Programming Interface (API) is used to interact with
   and control an application programatically. Just as a User Interface
   (UI) allows a human user to interact with an application, an API
   allows a separate piece of code to interact with an application. An
   API can be used to send input data, receive output data, configure
   settings, and trigger actions within an application.
Web Service
   Web Services are computational services accessed over a computer
   network. Typically, when people talk about web services, they are
   referring to a standardized web service communication protocol. The 2
   web service protocols which are currently the most popular are SOAP
   and REST.
REST
   Although the above paragraph indicates REpresentational State
   Transfer (REST) is a web service protocol, strictly speaking, it is
   an architecture or design framework. The REST architectural ideas are
   applied by using the HTTP protocol for information transport. REST
   uses the standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, etc) to define
   different types of actions, and URLs to indicate where a request
   should be sent and what input data to use. When sending or receiving
   data, complex data structures are typically defined using JSON or
   XML.
Standardized
   BrAPI is an attempt to standardize the commands and data structures
   needed for typical plant breeding applications.
Specification
   At the core, BrAPI is a standardized Specification. BrAPI is not a
   tool for transporting data, it only documentation which describes how
   to transport data.
