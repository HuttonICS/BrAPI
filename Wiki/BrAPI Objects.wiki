Info about the data model used in [[ BrAPI ]]
== General Response Structure ==

The return objects are encoded in JSON. The response consists of:
* A "metadata" key containing pagination, status, and file information;
* A "result" key that can contain:
** Arbitrary properties; and/or
** A "data" key containing an array of objects of the same type.


=== The Metadata ===

The metadata key is structured as followed:


  "metadata" : {
      "pagination" : {
            "totalCount" : 1234,
            // total number of elements available in the super set (unpaged)
            "pageSize" : 200,
            // number of elements in the current returned page
            "totalPages" : 7,
            // total number of pages available (total count / requested page size)
            "currentPage" : 2
            // index number of the current returned page
       },
       "status" : [
           {
               "code" : "200",
               "message" : "Success"
           }
       ],
       "asynchStatus": {
           "asynchId": "abc123"
           "status": "PENDING",
           "startTime": "2017-06-16T14:47:23-0600",
           "endTime": null,
           "percentComplete": 0
       },
       "datafiles" : ["/mnt/local/matrix_01.csv",
                      "/mnt/local/matrix_02.csv"]
   }


*  '''pagination''': The `pagination` object is applicable only when the payload contains a "data" key. It describes the pagination of the data contained in the "data" array, as a way to identify which subset of data is being returned. Pages are zero indexed, so the first page will be page 0 (zero).

*  '''datafiles''': The `datafiles` key contains a list of file paths, which can be relative or complete URLs. These files contain additional information related to the returned object and can be retrieved by a subsequent call. The empty list should be returned if no additional data files are present.

* '''asynchStatus''': (Optional) The `asynchStatus` object is used to provide additional information around certain calls being performed asynchronously. See the section on Asynchronous Calls for more details.

*  '''status''': The `status` object contains a list of objects with the keys "code" and "message". If no status is reported, an empty list should be returned. 

{{note|The Status object should be used ''in addition'' to the standard [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes HTTP status codes]. The purpose is to provide additional, BrAPI specific information back to the client.}}

The following are officially accepted status codes, though others maybe used for specific implementation needs.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|4003
|"Permission Denied"
| Error to be returned when the user does not have permission to access the requested resource

=== The Result ===

The BRAPI response payload, which is contained in the "result" key, allows for three different types of responses:
* '''master''': In this type of response, the "result" key consists of arbitrary properties without a "data" key (in this case, pagination does not apply). 

 {
  "metadata" : {
    "pagination" : {
      "totalCount" : 0,
      "pageSize" : 0,
      "totalPages" : 0,
      "currentPage" : 0
    },
    "status" : [ ],
    "datafiles" : [ ]
  },
  "result" : {
    "key0": "master",
    "key1": 20,
    "key2": [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]
  }
 }
 
* '''detail''': In this type of response, the "result" element only contains the "data" key, which is an arbitrarily long array of objects of the same type. 

 {
  "metadata" : {
    "pagination" : {
      "totalCount" : 20,
      "pageSize" : 3,
      "totalPages" : 7,
      "currentPage" : 0
    },
    "status" : [ ],
    "datafiles" : [ ]
  },
  "result" : {
    "data" : [ 
      {
        "detailKey0" : "detail0",
        "detailKey1" : [ "foo", "bar" ]
      }, 
      {
        "detailKey0" : "detail1",
        "detailKey1" : [ "bar", "baz" ]
      }, 
      {
        "detailKey0" : "detail2",
        "detailKey1" : [ "baz", "foo" ]
      },
    ]
  }
 }


* '''master/detail''': In this type of response, the "result" key contains both arbtirary properties and the "data" key. 

 {
     "metadata": {
         "pagination": {
             "totalCount": 20,
             "pageSize": 3,
             "totalPages": 7,
             "currentPage": 0
         },
         "status": [{
                 "code": "200",
                 "message": "Success"
             }
         ]
         "datafiles": ["/mnt/local/matrix_01.csv",
             "/mnt/local/matrix_02.csv"]
     },
     "result": {
         "key0": "master",
         "key1": 20,
         "key2": ["foo", "bar", "baz"],
         "data": [{
                 "detailKey0": "detail0",
                 "detailKey1": ["foo", "bar"]
             }, {
                 "detailKey0": "detail1",
                 "detailKey1": ["bar", "baz"]
             }, {
                 "detailKey0": "detail2",
                 "detailKey1": ["baz", "foo"]
             },
         ]
     }
 }
