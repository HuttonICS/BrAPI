== Trial Search : Identify Trial and studies by metadata/linked data==
* Description

Find all studies by : germplasm (variety, species, genbank accession, panel, population/collection), trait (specific trait, category like yield or phenology, ontology driven search), location (country, town, laboratory), year, project
* Data types

Studies with minimal metadata.

== Trial Search : Display Trial and studies on a map==
* Description

Find all studies by : germplasm (variety, species, genbank accession, panel, population/collection), trait (specific trait, category like yield or phenology, ontology driven search), location (country, town, laboratory), year, project
* Data types

Map (google map / Open street map type ) with al trial spoted

== Get all germplasm/traits for a specific dataset==
* Description

Given a trial search result, list all germplasm (variety, species, genbank accession, panel, population/collection) and display them in dedicated list. This is to help fine data querying. There is the same need for traits.
* Data type

List of display name/id/sourceID.

== Get all phenotype data for a given germplasm/year/trait/location==
* Description

Find the phenotype data by : germplasm (variety, species, genbank accession, panel, population/collection), trait (specific trait, category like yield or phenology, ontology driven search), location (country, town, laboratory), year, project, trial/study.
Note that we don’t want full trial/study data but only a subset. 
* Data type

Sufficient information to build a data set for genetic/phenotypic meta analysis : germplasm identification, treatments name and description, studyId, Observations (trait, value, date), year, location.
