Get common SNPs markers for germplasm used in a breeding program and landraces or wild material available in genebanks.

'''Description'''

Find all germplasm by taxonomy (variety, species, genebank accession, panel) and location (country, town) Find all allele matrix related to these germplasm

'''Data types'''

Germplasm with minimal passport data. Allele matrix

'''Story 1'''

As a banana breeder, I want to compare allelic diversity from my breeding lines with existing diverstiy available in genebank and display them in a user-friendly way. I want to retrieve list of germplasm from MGIS and from MusaBase, then retrieve common markers between the two datasets and visualize a chromosome area with Flapjack.
